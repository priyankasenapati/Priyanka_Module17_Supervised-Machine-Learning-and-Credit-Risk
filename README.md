# Supervised Machine Learning: Credit Risk Study

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of   risky loans. Therefore, we have to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We     will use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Final task is to  ecaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Objectives:-
The goals of this challenge is to:
* Implement machine learning models.
* Use resampling to attempt to address class imbalance.
* Evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

## Various Models and Alogorithms used:-
1. Oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms.

2. Undersample the data using the cluster centroids algorithm.

3. A combination approach with the SMOTEENN algorithm.

## Extension:-
Train, evaluate and compare two different ensemble classifiers listed below to predict loan risk.
1. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
2. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier

## Resources:-
* Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.4, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn and Imbalanced-learn libraries

## Process:-
1. Split the datasets.
2. Create a Model .
3. Train the Model.
4. Create Predictions.
5. Validate the Model.

## Summary:-
The full analysis of the models is provided at the bottom of each ipynb file. It describes the precision and recall scores, as well as the balanced accuracy score for each model. Additionally, it also includes a final recommendation on the model to use, if any with a reasoning.
